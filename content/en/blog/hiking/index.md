<b>Must-do routes to explore the area</b>

One of the natural gems of the region is, without a doubt, the Fragas do Eume Natural Park—one of the best-preserved Atlantic forests in Europe. Just a 30-minute drive from Miño, it offers trails for all levels, winding through oak trees, giant ferns, crystal-clear rivers, and ancient monasteries hidden in the vegetation. It’s the perfect spot for a day trip.

But you don’t have to go far to enjoy nature. Another option is a short route between the beach of Cabanas and Redes, shaded by trees and running along a seaside path with great views. There are also trails that follow the coastline toward Perbes or Ponte do Porco, ideal for peaceful sunset walks.

Of course, we can’t forget the Camino de Santiago—specifically, the English Way—which passes just a few meters from the apartment and crosses the nearby town of Pontedeume. Many pilgrims walk through this area on their way to Santiago, carrying with them a tradition that blends spirituality, hospitality, and discovery. Walking along its stretches means reliving centuries of history—and it’s a wonderful way to connect with Galicia’s deepest culture.

<b>A way to experience Miño at your own pace</b>

Hiking in Miño doesn’t require great effort or special equipment. It’s more about walking slowly, looking around, and letting yourself be guided by the surroundings. Whether it’s walking rural paths between villages, discovering hidden spots in the nearby hills, or simply enjoying a stroll by the sea, this activity will allow you to experience the area in an authentic and relaxed way. And the best part is—it’s all just minutes from the apartment.
