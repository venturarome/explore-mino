Galicia is one of the regions with the richest gastronomy in Spain—and that’s no coincidence. Its Atlantic climate, the quality of its land and sea, and a strong culinary tradition have given rise to a unique pantry where authenticity, natural flavor, and respect for seasonal ingredients prevail. From the sea to the mountains, Galician food reflects a culture that celebrates good eating as part of its identity.

<b>From the sea: freshness and international prestige</b>

- **Galician seafood**: Galicia is synonymous with seafood. Spider crabs, velvet crabs, goose barnacles, clams, mussels, and scallops are harvested in its estuaries and consumed almost immediately. The Galician rías offer an ideal ecosystem that gives worldwide fame to their seafood.
- **Octopus**: The famous *pulpo á feira* (boiled octopus with coarse salt, paprika, and olive oil) is an essential dish at fairs, festivals, and pilgrimages. Its tender texture and unmistakable flavor make it one of the greatest emblems of Galician cuisine.
- **Atlantic fish**: Hake, turbot, sea bass, monkfish... Galicia offers fish of extraordinary quality, often cooked in the oven, grilled, or in traditional stews like *caldeirada*.

<b>From the land: products with character</b>

- **Galician veal**: One of the most recognized quality labels in Spain. Raised on Galician pastures, this beef stands out for its mild flavor and tender texture—ideal for barbecues or stews.
- **Galician bread**: With a thick crust, spongy crumb, and deep flavor. *Pan de Cea* (from Ourense) is one of the most prized, but any traditional Galician bakery offers true artisan gems.
- **Cheeses**: Galicia produces several protected designation of origin cheeses, such as *Tetilla*, the smoked *San Simón da Costa*, and *Arzúa-Ulloa*—each with a unique personality.

<b>Sweets and wines: the perfect finish</b>

- **Tarta de Santiago**: Made from ground almonds, eggs, and sugar, this traditional tart is recognizable by the cross of Saint James dusted in powdered sugar.
- **Filloas and orejas**: Typical during Carnival, these fried sweets resemble French crêpes (*filloas*) or Spanish-style fried pastries (*orejas*).
- **Galician wines**: *Albariño* (Rías Baixas) is the best known, ideal with seafood. Also noteworthy are *Godello*, *Mencía*, and wines from *Ribeira Sacra*—all with Atlantic character and growing international recognition.

<b>Eating in Galicia is a cultural experience in itself</b>

Exploring Galician cuisine is a way to connect with its roots, its landscapes, and its way of life. Every product tells a story; every recipe carries a family memory. Whether at a local market, a pilgrimage celebration, or a restaurant, the flavors of Galicia will be a key part of your visit.
