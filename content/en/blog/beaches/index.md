<b>Quality, Variety, and Breathtaking Landscapes</b>

Miño boasts fine sand beaches with clean waters, many of them recognized for their quality and services. Playa Grande de Miño is the most well-known: a wide golden-sand bay with a seafront promenade, lifeguard services, and areas suitable for family swimming. Just a short distance away is Playa Pequeña, more sheltered and quiet, perfect for those seeking a relaxed atmosphere.

In the surrounding area, natural gems like Playa de Perbes stand out—a sandy beach protected by a forested setting—and Playa de Ber, much loved for its beauty and local vibe.

<b>From Miño to Ferrol: A Paradise of Wild Beaches</b>

If you’re looking for the most Atlantic side of Galicia, with wide, open, and wild beaches, the coast stretching toward Ferrol offers a natural spectacle that’s hard to match. Playa de Doniños, with its vast stretch, untouched character, and constant waves, is perfect for both surfers and those looking to get lost among dunes and endless horizons. Nearby, beaches like Santa Comba or San Jorge enchant with their untamed beauty, towering cliffs, and trails that allow you to discover Galicia step by step, surrounded by salty winds and the scent of eucalyptus.

<b>Playa de las Catedrales: An Iconic Landmark of Galicia</b>

And when talking about symbols, we must mention Playa de las Catedrales on the Lugo coast—one of the most spectacular landscapes in Spain. Its stone arches, sculpted by sea and time, offer a natural show that feels otherworldly. Walking among these formations at low tide is a magical experience, where nature's artistry reaches its highest expression.
