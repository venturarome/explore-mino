<b>Miño Market</b>

In the town of Miño itself, a traditional open-air market is held every Sunday morning. Located in the town center, next to the church and the seafront promenade, this market is popular with both locals and visitors. Here you can find:
- Fresh fruit and vegetables from the region.
- Artisan bread and Galician empanadas.
- Cheeses, cured meats, and homemade preserves.
- Clothing, footwear, and household items.

During the summer, this market becomes especially lively—a perfect place for a stroll, to buy a gourmet souvenir, or to enjoy a coffee on a nearby terrace.

<b>Pontedeume Market</b>

Held on Saturday mornings in its picturesque historic center. It's ideal for combining shopping with a walk along the waterfront or a visit to the Andrade castle.

<b>Betanzos Market</b>

Just a 15-minute drive away, the Betanzos Municipal Market is one of the most complete and historic in the area. The building, located next to the Hermanos García Naveira square, blends tradition and modernity.

Inside, you'll find stalls with fresh seafood from the estuary, high-quality meats, organic products, and even prepared dishes.

Betanzos is famous for its tortilla, and it’s not uncommon to hear tips and recommendations at the market stalls for making it the proper way: soft on the inside and golden on the outside.

In addition, special outdoor markets are sometimes held on Saturdays, featuring artisanal, organic, or second-hand goods.

<b>Sada Market</b>

This coastal town hosts food markets as well as a vintage or craft fair on some Sundays. The atmosphere is relaxed—perfect for a quiet morning by the sea.

<b>Conclusion: a journey for the senses</b>

Galician markets are much more than places of commerce. They are a living part of the culture, where every conversation and every product tells a story. If you're visiting Miño, setting aside a morning to enjoy one of these markets will let you truly taste Galicia from the inside out.
