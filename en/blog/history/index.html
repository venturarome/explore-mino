These structures reveal an organized society, closely tied to the land and the natural environment. Celtic influences left a deep mark on Galician culture, visible in its music, symbols, rituals, and the way communities related to their landscape.</p><p><b>Origins and Historical Evolution</b></p><p>The history of Miño, a town located between the estuaries of Betanzos and Ares, fits into this age-old context. Its strategic position, close to ancient communication routes, encouraged human settlement from very early times. The first signs of human presence in the area date back to pre-Roman times, with remains of Celtic <em>castros</em> in the surroundings, confirming its importance within the network of fortified settlements in the northwest of the Iberian Peninsula.
With the arrival of the Romans, these lands became part of the administrative and commercial fabric of the Empire. Romanization brought improvements in agriculture and new connections with other coastal settlements. Later, during the Middle Ages, Miño became part of the English Way (<em>Camino Inglés</em>), one of the pilgrimage routes to Santiago, making it a regular stop for pilgrims, merchants, and clergy. In this period, rural parishes were consolidated, and small Romanesque churches were built, some of which are still preserved today.
During the 19th and 20th centuries, the local economy was mainly based on agriculture, fishing, and emigration. Many residents sought a future in the Americas, especially in Cuba and Argentina, while maintaining ties with their homeland. In the second half of the 20th century, Miño began to transform into a summer destination for families from A Coruña, Ferrol, and Lugo, leading to significant urban development in areas such as Costa Miño Golf.</p><p><b>A Present that Honors its Past</b></p><p>Today, Miño is a town that blends tradition and modernity. Its urban center retains its welcoming character, while its new developments and services attract both tourists and residents. Miño’s history lives not only in books, but also in its cobbled paths, local festivals, popular wisdom, and the surrounding landscape. With a population of around 5,500 inhabitants, the town is experiencing steady growth, especially in summer, when its natural beauty and tourist offerings bring its streets to life.</p></div><div class=toc><nav id=TableOfContents></nav></div></div></article></div><div id=navigator><div class=navigator><div class=navigator-item><a class="left item-link" href=https://venturarome.github.io/explore-mino/en/blog/galician-cuisine/><span><i class="bi bi-chevron-left"></i></span>
